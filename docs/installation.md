## Create a conda environment (Linux and Windows)

If you do not have conda, we recommend installing [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

Then, in your command line tool:

1. Create a conda environment
    
    ```bash
    conda create -n 'napari-n2v' python=3.9
    conda activate napari-n2v
    ```
    
2. Install the packages necessary to use GPU-acceleration
    
    ```bash
    conda install cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn git -c conda-forge
    pip install tensorflow==2.7
    ```
    
3. Install the latest version of N2V
    
    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/juglab/n2v.git
    ```
    
4. Install napari
    
    ```bash
    pip install "napari[all]"
    ```
   
   Note that `pip` might complain about `typing-extensions` versions, just ignore it.
